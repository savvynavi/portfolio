Portfolio for interview, 6 pieces of code

palindrome
	- Saves integers in a vector and then checks if it's a palindrome
    compile: g++ palindrome.cpp -o palindrome
    usage: ./palindrome

palindromeString
	- Takes string and checks if it's a palindrome
    compile: g++ palindromeString.cpp -o palindromeString
    usage: ./palindromeString

sqr
    - Solves for the smallest x for the equation a squared <= x cubed < b squared
    NOTE: The dlx tools (dsim.jar and dasm.jar are needed), not supplied, also dsim has a bug where it occasionally freezes on multicore systems
    assemble: taskset -c 0 java -jar dsim.jar
    usage: java -jar dsim.jar (then load sqr.dlx from cpu)

restaurant
	- OOP project, takes in restaurant name, number of guests and then lets you order from a selection of food and drink objects, before printing
    out the price
    compile: make
    usage: ./restaurant
    
bookshelf
	- Lets you store up to 10 books (as strings) in a vector
	compile: g++ shelf.cpp shelf.h main.cpp -o shelf
	usage: ./shelf
	
oop vehicle
	- creates a bike and car objects, both inherited from a vehicle object, and shows the states of each
	compile: g++ main.cpp vehicle.cpp vehicle.h car.cpp car.h bicycle.h bicycle.cpp -o run
	usage: ./run
